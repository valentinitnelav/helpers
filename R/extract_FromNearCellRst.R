    ## Function to extract to given XY point the closest valid cell values from raster.
    ## Specifically, for all points that the usual raster::extract() returns NA,
    ## it searches for the closest non-NA cell value within given buffer (typically meters).
    ## All other points returned by the usual raster::extract() are kept as such.
    ## It uses nn2 {RANN} to fast compute neighbors based on Euclidean distances.
    ## The fact that Euclidean and not great circle distances (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) 
    ## are used does not alter the nearest neighbor search
    ## (check https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/7622/fast-nearest-neighbor-search-latitude-longitude?newreg=0daf766b1e5446bcaed39aee02153f26
    ## for an interesting discusion).
    ## ___ Arguments
    ## rst        - raster object
    ## XY         - data.table with two columns: first column=longitude; second column=latitude
    ## my.buffer  - same as in raster::extract(); "The radius of a buffer around each point from which to extract cell values. [...]
    ##              If the data are not projected (latitude/longitude), the unit should be meters. 
    ##              Otherwise it should be in map-units (typically also meters)".
    ##              buffer needs to be at least the raster's resolution (one cell)
    ## simplified - Logical argument. TRUE means that the result is a data.table with only one column - the extracted raster values.
    ##              If FALSE, then 5 extra columns are added: 
    ##               the coordinates (2 columns), 
    ##               the ID of the raster cells where the points fall, 
    ##               the raster cell values and 
    ##               a column that indicates for each point if a buffer was used (NA means NO, 1 means YES)
    ## ___ Returns
    ## data.table object (check "simplified" argument above)
